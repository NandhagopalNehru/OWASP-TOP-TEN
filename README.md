# OWASP-TOP-TEN
OWASP top ten explaination

OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) is a non-profit organization that aims to improve the security of software and web applications. The OWASP Top Ten is a list of the most common web application vulnerabilities, updated every few years to reflect the changing threat landscape.

Here are the OWASP Top Ten Vulnerabilities as of 2017- Early 2021:

Injection: Injection vulnerabilities occur when user-supplied data is interpreted as part of a command or query, allowing an attacker to manipulate the application's behavior. Examples include SQL injection and command injection.

Broken Authentication and Session Management: This vulnerability arises when an attacker is able to bypass or otherwise exploit the authentication and session management mechanisms of an application, allowing them to access sensitive information or perform unauthorized actions.

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): XSS vulnerabilities occur when an attacker is able to inject malicious code into a web page, which is then executed by a victim's browser. This can allow the attacker to steal user credentials or perform other malicious actions.

Broken Access Control: Access control vulnerabilities arise when an attacker is able to bypass or otherwise exploit the application's authorization mechanisms, allowing them to access sensitive resources or perform unauthorized actions.

Security Misconfiguration: This vulnerability arises when an application or system is not properly configured, leaving it open to attacks such as brute-force attacks, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other types of attacks.

Insecure Cryptographic Storage: This vulnerability arises when sensitive data is not properly encrypted or is stored in an insecure manner, allowing an attacker to access and exploit the data.

Insufficient Logging and Monitoring: This vulnerability arises when an application or system does not properly log events or monitor for suspicious activity, making it difficult to detect and respond to attacks.

Insecure Communication: This vulnerability arises when an application or system communicates sensitive information over an insecure channel, allowing an attacker to intercept and exploit the data.

Improper Error Handling: This vulnerability arises when an application or system does not properly handle errors, leaving it open to attacks such as cross-site scripting (XSS), and other types of attacks.

Insecure Design: This vulnerability arises when an application or system is designed with security flaws or vulnerabilities, making it difficult or impossible to secure after the fact.

It is important for developers and organizations to be aware of these vulnerabilities and take steps to mitigate the risks they pose. Regular security testing, code reviews, and adherence to secure coding practices can help to address these vulnerabilities and protect against attacks.
